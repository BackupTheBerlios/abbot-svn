tell doesn't distinguish channels, on which to deliver message

tell should be recompiled, if Plugins was changed (otherwise type check skips plugin loading)

Everything compiled into single "./Debug Output" directory,
additional directories, like "Data", "Logs" are not created automatically

message from console goes only to the first channel

google plugin doesn't work (API link returns 404)
